# Ballerina Jira Connector


This Ballerina client connector allows to connect to [Atlassian JIRA](https://www.jira.com), an online issue-tracking database. It provides bug tracking, 
issue tracking, and project management functions.
The connector uses the [JIRA REST API version 7.2.2](https://docs.atlassian.com/software/jira/docs/api/REST/7.2.2/) to connect to JIRA, work with JIRA projects, 
view and update issues, work with jira user accounts, and more.

### Why do you need the REST API for Jira

The Jira REST API is an ideal solution for the developers who want to integrate JIRA with other standalone or web applications, 
and administrators who want to script interactions with the JIRA server. Because the Jira REST API is based on open 
standards, you can use any web development language to access the API.
